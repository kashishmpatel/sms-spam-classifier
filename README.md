# Introduction
The SMS Spam Classifier is a machine learning project that classifies SMS messages as either "spam" or "ham" (non-spam). The model is trained using a dataset of labeled SMS messages and leverages the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) vectorizer to transform the text data into numerical features. The project employs various Python libraries for data processing, visualization, natural language processing, and deployment using Streamlit.
